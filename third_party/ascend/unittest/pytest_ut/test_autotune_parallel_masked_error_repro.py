Regression test: an autotune kernel with a config that fails to compile.

Runs on both triton-ascend-3.6 and 3.7.  With parallel compilation (the
default), on 3.7 ``AutoTilingTuner._batch_bench`` used to raise the compile
error of the first bad config while *submitting* the configs
(``FutureKernel.__getattr__`` eagerly resolving the future on the
``packed_metadata`` read inside ``_make_kernel_call``), where it escaped the
per-config try/except and was swallowed by the catch-all handler -- aborting
the whole autotune with ``RuntimeError: No valid triton configs. NoneType:
None``.

After the fix the compile error surfaces at ``fut.result()`` inside the
per-config try/except: the bad config is silently dropped and autotune
completes with the remaining config.  This test asserts that end to end:
no exception, and the output matches the reference computed with the
surviving config.  On 3.6 the per-config handler already drops the failing
config, so the test passes there as well.

Since the upstream make_block_ptr rewrite (aggregate-based materialization,
triton 3.8), a zero-stride checked axis no longer reaches TritonToLinalg's
``getBoundarySizes()`` (the block pointer is materialized into plain pointer
arithmetic before lowering), so the STRIDE0=0 config compiles and would be
benchmarked like any other.  The compile-failing config is therefore
triggered with ``tl.static_assert`` instead: config #1 asserts a false
condition (STRIDE0=0) and fails compilation, config #2 passes and produces
the reference output.
